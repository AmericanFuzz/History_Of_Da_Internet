# History_Of_Da_Internet
This website is dedicated for the NHD project I have to do in high school sophomore year with 2 friends

NHD(National History Day) is a competitive acedemic event that has a final project that can take many forms, including a poster, performance, or website. I am pissed off that I was told to use a webite builder (**ew**), so I decided to make my own website with one friend as the layout designer, one friend as graphics, and me as the programmer.

At the time of writing this, I am a dumb teenager, and do make more mistakes than medival inquisitors. This is why my website slowly formed what it is now rather than immediately was perfect. I will give you the option to see the most recent as well as the old:

**Note to history:** This idea of programming a website was rejected by my peers, by my former "friends", and even by the head of NHD. Who was the only person(besides my family) who did not oppose me and my friends dream work?

-> Mr. Hales, the legend who does his job, his passion, and his own dreams, not his "job" to snuff out kids who want to do something new, not the "job" NHD heads want him to do.
