# History_Of_Da_Internet
This website is dedicated for the NHD project I have to do in high school sophomore year with 2 friends

NHD(National History Day) is a competitive acedemic event that has a final project that can take many forms, including a poster, performance, or website. I am pissed off that I was told to use a webite builder (**ew**), so I decided to make my own website with one friend as the layout designer, one friend as graphics, and me as the programmer.

At the time of writing this, I am a dumb teenager, and do make more mistakes than medival inquisitors. This is why my website slowly formed what it is now rather than immediately was perfect. I will give you the option to see the most recent as well as the old:
