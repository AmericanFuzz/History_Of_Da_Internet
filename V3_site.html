<!--Comments also can go across several lines, like this:
        And this:
    
                        Pretty cool.-->

<!--"Tags" are the things that go: <></>, while "Attributes" are one - liners like: img<> -->
<!--Tags and Attributes can be put in each other, as long as they close in order of getting opened.-->

<!--The basic setup like void loop() and void setup() in c++ are in HTML with the pattern:

<html>                                              (set up the website to exist) 
    <head>                                          
                                                    (name the "tab" in the browser of your website)
    </head>

    <body>
                                                    (actual website contents)
    </body>
</html>                                             (close website file to be presented)

That's pretty much it I think.-->

<!--The little icon on the tab is called a favicon, and has to be a 16*16 or 32*32 square .ico or .gif or .png-->

<html lang="en"> <!--open up the website with the "html" -->

    <head> <!--name the tab-->
        <title>HistoryOfDaInternet</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="https://americanfuzz.github.io/History_Of_Da_Internet/favicon.ico">
    </head>
