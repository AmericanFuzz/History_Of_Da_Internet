<!--This is how you comment to remember things(you cannot put a comment in a comment):-->

<!--Comments also can go across several lines, like this:
        And this:
    
                        Pretty cool.-->

<!--"Tags" are the things that go: <></>, while "Attributes" are one - liners like: img<> -->
<!--Tags and Attributes can be put in each other, as long as they close in order of getting opened.-->

<!--The basic setup like void loop() and void setup() in c++ are in HTML with the pattern:

<html>                                              (set up the website to exist) 
    <head>                                          
                                                    (name the "tab" in the browser of your website)
    </head>

    <body>
                                                    (actual website contents)
    </body>
</html>                                             (close website file to be presented)

That's pretty much it I think.-->

<!--The little icon on the tab is called a favicon, and has to be a 16*16 or 32*32 square .ico or .gif or .png-->
<!--I got my favion(s) by designing and downloading them on the website: "favicon.cc"-->

<!--SAVE EVERYTHING BEFORE OPENING IN BROWSER, OR THERE WILL BE NO NEW RESULTS!!!

*** INCLUDING JAVASCRIPT AND CSS FILES!!!-->

<!--You don't actually need tags to write text, just type anything anyhow, and you will see text(it will be default crappy text though with no control)-->


<!--"class" sets the categories of tags that can be modified from css, AND EVERYTHING IN THEM!

example: 

HTML
<div class = "redText">
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <h1>Goodbye</h1>
</div>

CSS
.redText{
    fontColor: .red;
}

This will make all of the text h1's and anything else red! BAD!

do this:

HTML
<div>
    <h1 class = "green">Hello</h1>
    <h1 class = "red">Goodbye</h1>
</div>

CSS
.green{
    fontColor: .green;
}
.red{
    fontColor: .red;
}
-->

<!--<br> is a simple line breaker(new line in <p></p>)-->
